# Majo's first Discord bot

This is my first ever Discord bot.
It's still a work in progress, and I'll mostly use it to test and learn stuff.

**Setup**
*(The bot should run with Docker in the near future)*

**Create and deploy new slash command :**
    - Add commmand file in `/commands` as `<command-name>.mjs`;
    - `node deploy_commands.js` ;
    - Slash commands should be ready!
